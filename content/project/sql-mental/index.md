### Summary of the project:

Background

:   Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness and acculturative stress are predictive of depression.


Task

:   Find out if would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.
