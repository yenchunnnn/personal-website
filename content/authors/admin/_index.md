Thanks for stopping by. :blush:

Coming from a background in social psychology and clinical psychology, I'm passionate about exploring human issues through analytics. If you’re looking for someone to drive positive impact in our society, please feel free to contact me!

Fun fact: I'm obsessed with learning about other cultures. So far, I've exchanged thoughts with people from 20+ nationalities, including US, Estonia, Serbia, Türkiye, Iran, Armenia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, etc. :relieved:
