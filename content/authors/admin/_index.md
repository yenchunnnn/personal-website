Thanks for stopping by! {{< icon name="face-laugh-beam" pack="far" >}}

I’m a data analyst. Coming from a background in social psychology and clinical psychology, I’m passionate about solving social problems and mental health issues with analytics as well. I have over 1 year of experience applying psychological research methods in real-world settings, from designing experiments, collecting, preprocessing, analyzing, and modeling data to presenting insights.
