abstract: Positivity resonance theory defines the emotion of love as a collective affective state, referred to as positivity resonance, characterized by shared positive affect, caring nonverbal synchrony, and biological synchrony. This study examined whether daily experiences of positivity resonance concurrently and prospectively influence meaning in life (MIL) through the increment of social connection. At time 1 (N = 144), perceived positivity resonance was measured at the trait level, along with MIL and social connection. Next, perceived positivity resonance was assessed at the episodic level via the Day Reconstruction Method across seven days (N = 135). Finally, two follow-up surveys were administered one (N = 113) and two months (N = 99) later. Participants again completed the questionnaires on MIL and social connection. Results suggest that social connection cross-sectionally and longitudinally mediates the links between perceived positivity resonance and MIL. These mediating effects remain statistically significant even after controlling for the individual-level positive and negative affect and amount of social interaction. These findings indicate that momentary experience of love while interacting with others may be an influential way to a meaningful life.

The conference was hosted by the Taiwanese Psychological Association.

This paper is largely based on my master's thesis ---

> Chen, Y. C., & Lee, Y. C. (2024). Love in Everyday Social Interactions: Accumulating Meaning in Life through Positivity Resonance. *Chinese Journal of Psychology(TSSCI), 66*(3), 361-388. https://doi.org/10.6129/CJP.202409_66(3).0003

What I've done in this research:

-   Research method: Day Reconstruction Method, Longitudinal Research

    -   Held six real-time or online group debriefings to recruit participants, maintaining a 4.9% attrition rate at time 1.

    -   Used Qualtrics to collect data.

-   Statistical model: Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling

    -   I learned how to use R to analyze in one month.

It's the first time I've come across <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> when working on this research. Since then, I've stuck with it! ðŸ¤©
