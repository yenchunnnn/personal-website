abstract: The positivity resonance theory defines the emotion of love as a collective affective state which is termed â”€ positivity resonance, characterized by shared positive affect, caring nonverbal synchrony, and biological synchrony. The present study examined whether daily experiences of positivity resonance influence meaning in life (MIL) through the increment of social connection, both concurrently and prospectively. At time 1 (*N* = 144), we measured perceived positivity resonance at the trait level, MIL and social connection. Next, we assessed perceived positivity resonance at the episodic level with Day Reconstruction Method across 7 days (*N* = 135). Finally, two follow-up surveys were administered one month (*N* = 113) and two months (*N* = 99) later. Participants again completed the questionnaires of MIL and social connection. Results suggest that social connection mediates the links between perceived positivity resonance and MIL, both cross-sectionally, and longitudinally. These mediating effects remain statistically significant when controlling for the individual-level positive and negative affect, and social interaction quantity. These findings indicate that momentary experience of love while interacting with others, may be an influential way to a meaningful life.

The conference was host by Taiwanese Psychological Association.

This paper is largely based on my master's thesis---

> Chen, Y. C., & Lee, Y. C. (accepted). Love in Everyday Social Interactions Matters: Positivity Resonance Accumulates Meaning in Life. *Chinese Journal of Psychology.* (TSSCI)

What I've done in this research:

-   Research method: day reconstruction method, longitudinal research

    -   Held 6 real-time or online group debriefing to recruit participants, with only 4.9% attrition rate at time 1.
    
    - Used Qualtrics to collect data.

-   Statistical model: multilevel structural equation modeling

    -   Learned how to use <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> to analyze in one month.
